The pfpro_functions.php file provides a number of functions to simplify
interacting with PayPal's PayFlowPro service.

It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the pfpro PHP extension.
If the pfpro extension is enabled, the functions defined in this file
will cause PHP to issue an error and exit. Make sure the pfpro.so
extension is not enabled.
